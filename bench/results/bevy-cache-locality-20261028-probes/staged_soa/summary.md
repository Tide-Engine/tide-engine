Verified 9 processes in 3 alternating rounds.

ECS ticks only; excludes setup, snapshots, per-tick hashing, networking and rendering.

Times are milliseconds per tick, median of process medians. Ranges are process-median min/max.
Bevy/Tide is the median paired ratio; values above 1 favor Tide.

| Case | Threads | Tide ms (range) | Bevy ms (range) | C ms | Bevy/Tide |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| filtered-frozen99-1m-1 | 1 | 0.139550 (0.139550–0.140800) | 0.048400 (0.047950–0.048700) | 1.234500 | 0.347× |

Adjacent before/current comparison; Before/Tide above 1 favors the current Tide.
Change is the median paired percentage change in time (negative is faster).
