Verified 9 processes in 3 alternating rounds.

ECS ticks only; excludes setup, snapshots, per-tick hashing, networking and rendering.

Times are milliseconds per tick, median of process medians. Ranges are process-median min/max.
Bevy/Tide is the median paired ratio; values above 1 favor Tide.

| Case | Threads | Tide ms (range) | Bevy ms (range) | C ms | Bevy/Tide |

| filtered-frozen99-1m-1 | 1 | 0.161400 (0.158500–0.174650) | 0.052200 (0.047900–0.053350) | 1.203950 | 0.305× |

Adjacent before/current comparison; Before/Tide above 1 favors the current Tide.
Change is the median paired percentage change in time (negative is faster).
