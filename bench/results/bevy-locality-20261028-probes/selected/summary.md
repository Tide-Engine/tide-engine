Verified 9 processes in 3 alternating rounds.

ECS ticks only; excludes setup, snapshots, per-tick hashing, networking and rendering.

Times are milliseconds per tick, median of process medians. Ranges are process-median min/max.
Bevy/Tide is the median paired ratio; values above 1 favor Tide.

| Case | Threads | Tide ms (range) | Bevy ms (range) | C ms | Bevy/Tide |

| filtered-frozen99-1m-1 | 1 | 0.277100 (0.254900–0.295450) | 0.048650 (0.048100–0.049300) | 1.208150 | 0.176× |

Adjacent before/current comparison; Before/Tide above 1 favors the current Tide.
Change is the median paired percentage change in time (negative is faster).
