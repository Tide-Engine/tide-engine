# FOLDLINE prototype

Added on 2026-10-12 at the owner's request: an original 3D, first-person,
Portal 2 cooperative puzzle inspiration with freedom to add a twist and an
emphasis on appearance. The owner explicitly required portals to render the
space inside them. Other repository games' source was not used as a reference;
implementation follows Tide's public documentation and subsystem contracts.

## Match and controls

`prototypes/foldline/play.tide` contains a deterministic 60 Hz, two-player match.
Two `Operator` entities always exist, with `Owner` deciding whose input each
reads. The first player owns both until the second joins; solo input selects
one operator and the other remains in place. Leaving restores both bodies to
the remaining player. Built-in rooms/session operations supply online co-op
and host migration; there is no game-specific network or runtime change.

`Arena` stores chamber, pressure circuits, latched solution, gate/bridge and
completion state. `Fold` stores the shared pair of panel indices, loose cube,
carry state and partner ping. Match inputs contain movement, look and actions;
menu selection uses a bounded `SelectChamber` command with sender checks.

Portals are restricted to six vertical receptive panels. Mapping resolves a
point or vector in the entry panel's right/up/normal basis, turns right/normal
by 180 degrees and resolves it into the exit basis. Traversal maps position,
horizontal facing and velocity together. Destination collision checks use
destination coordinates. Short re-entry cooldowns restore solid-wall collision
until traversal is available again. Operators and the cube use bounded wall,
floor, divider and pit collision rather than a general rigid-body library.

The three experiments use one architectural layout with changed circuit
positions and rules: weight A, weight A and B together, then leave the cube
on A to power a bridge while an operator reaches B. Solutions latch. Both
operators must enter the exit to complete. Falling resets the fallen object.
The resonance bridge is the prototype's extension of the shared portal puzzle.

`ui.tide` owns menus, room sharing/joining, chamber choice, solo selection,
pointer lock, a minimal aiming reticle and circuit/objective displays. Menus
gate local input without pausing the match. Completion releases pointer lock
so the next-experiment control can be clicked. The README describes the player
controls and build commands. Gameplay supports keyboard/mouse and gamepad;
touchscreen movement is not implemented.

## Rendering

`render.tide` owns local geometry, materials and render targets. The scene is
original procedural architecture: limestone panels, dark machinery, warm and
cool luminous accents, planting and a skylit research atrium. The other
operator and held device are drawn in 3D.

Portal views use mapped cameras and render the real scene into separate local
targets. The portal surface samples the camera image by screen coordinates,
so the window into the destination has the same projection as the viewer.
Scene fragments clip against the destination portal plane. The renderer uses
a bounded second portal level, drawn from deepest to nearest into distinct
targets, rather than reading a destination target while writing it. Local GPU
resources are outside match state and never affect deterministic simulation.

## Integration and verification

The opt-in `TIDE_PRIVATE_PROTOTYPES` option includes native `foldline` and
`foldline_test`; web `foldline_page` stages the self-contained page at
`docs/static/prototypes/foldline/index.html`. The private catalog and public
path guards agree on `foldline`. Its thumbnail is taken from actual gameplay.
The C test host is isolated under `test/tide.packages` so `tide run` does not
discover it as game C. No external Tide package or asset download is needed.

Native and web debug game targets build without warnings. Scoped CTest suites
pass 2/2 native and 3/3 web: simulation tests and a real GPU fixture on OpenGL,
WebGL 2 and WebGPU. Simulation tests cover all 30 directed panel pairings,
position/facing/velocity transforms, operators and loose/carried cubes crossing
the divider, cooldown collision, solo/co-op assignment and leaving, menu input
gating, movement/jump/aim/ping/carry/drop, chamber solutions, command sender and
range guards, pit recovery, snapshots, packing and invalid numeric input repair.
The full-game replay hash agrees on native/WASI: `347114137472726277`.

`test/render_test.c` draws eleven scene configurations without intervening
simulation ticks. It checks geometry inside the portal against a solid wall,
live cube/partner motion beyond the exit, camera-side geometry clipped by the
exit plane, and lateral camera parallax against independently projected cube
positions. All assertions passed with their original tolerances, with GPU
validation enabled in both browser fixtures. The test uses the real renderer
and targets, rather than a separate approximation of portal rendering.

Native standard-host scripts check the menu, movement and view changes, and a
two-process co-op run walks operator B through the portal while A watches it
appear on the other side. Repeated co-op captures match byte for byte; the
catalog thumbnail is that actual gameplay frame. Visual inspection corrected
the first-person camera initially drawing its own robot body, which obscured
the lower scene; self geometry now draws only in portal passes. The polished
captures show compact equipment, warmer stone, roof shadows and chamber signs.

Docs checks and production/public-route validation are recorded in
`notes/docs-site.md`. The collaborative preview's snapshot operation failed,
so visual inspection used standard-host captures and the automated browser GPU
fixtures. A live Internet room with two human players was not exercised;
co-op validation used the standard host's deterministic two-process transport.
Linux/macOS/MinGW, Android and sanitizers were not run. No CI was dispatched.
